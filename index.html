                I'm a ghostwriter and technical content writer who helps tech
                professionals and founders turn their ideas into compelling,
                structured stories. My focus is on making complex topics simple,
                engaging, and readable — the kind of content that builds trust
                and authority.
              </p>
              <p>
                I care deeply about clarity and flow, and I write with the goal
                of helping readers <span class="boldtext">understand</span>, not
                just read. Whether I'm crafting an article, refining your story,
                or shaping your brand voice, I approach every project with
                precision, research, and a storyteller's touch.
